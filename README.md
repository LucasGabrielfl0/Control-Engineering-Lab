# Control-Engineering-Lab
Repository for my Control Engineering Laboratory class projects at UFPE
- The theory behind each project is explained in detail on the pdf file attached to each folder
- All the simulink files were made in simulink 2023b (but you could run it in some earlier versions)
- The experimental data collected in the lab was imported as a  .mat or .csv

## Project 1: Linearization
1. Linear and non linear aproximations of a Aeropendulum
2. Measure the step and frequency response of the Lab Kit 1 and estiamte the transfer function 

## Project 2: Analytical Models
1. Estimate the transfer function of the Kit 1 circuit with White box aproach
2. Estimate the transfer function of the Kit 2 circuit with Grey box aproach
3. Using MATLAB/Simulink files, compare the estimated transfer function and the simulated system's response

## Project 3: System Identification
Acquire and Simulate the transfer function of a unknown circuit 

## Project 4: Ziegler-Nichols Method
Apply the Zieggler-Nichols Method in a black box system

## Project 5: Pole Placement
Control Project using pole and zero cancelation

## Project 6: Analog Control
1. Design and Simulate an Analog PID controller for the Kit 1 Circuit
2. Design and Simulate an Analog PID controller for the Kit 2 Circuit

## Project 7: Cascade Control
Cascade Control of a Buck Converter done in MATLAB
1. Design and simulate a single Loop Control of the Buck Converter
2. Design and simulate a cascade Control of the Buck Converter, with a settling time (for the voltage loop) of 5 ms
3. Design and simulate a cascade Control of the Buck Converter, with a settling time (for the voltage loop) of 0.1 ms

[PIC MATLAB]

## Project 8: Signal Conditioning
Simulate Signal Conditioning
