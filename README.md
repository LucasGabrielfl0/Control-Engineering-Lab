# Control-Engineering-Lab
Repository for my Control Engineering Laboratory class projects at UFPE
- The theory behind each project is explained in detail on the slide attached to the folder
- All the simulink files were made in simulink 2023b (but you could run it in some earlier versions)
- The experimental data collected in the lab was imported as a  .mat or .csv
